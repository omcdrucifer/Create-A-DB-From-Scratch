A COMPLETE DATABASE FROM SCRATCH

The next portfolio project for CS Certification on CodeCademy.

I have to build a db from scratch. I still need to nail down the topic.

Either way I will keep a copy of the code used to build the db in this repo.

This is just to get the first commit in place.

Project involves postgresql. Will build it in a VM with postbird.

Obviously can't upload a DB to github, so these are the project files.

I am modeling this DB after what a health insurance market might look like

I interviewed my wife about the way they structure data where she works, but
only about the data structures, I did not ask her any specific information about
any clients, providers, etc that she works with as that would be a HIPAA violation.

As such this is a generic fictional model of a health insurance market.
